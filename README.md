# emo-detective

> **Preamble:** This notebook was adapted from an *Introduction to Machine Learning* course assignment. This notebook is intended to demonstrate a basic understanding of convolutional neural network architecture.
---

> **Goal:** To develop an emotion detection CNN-based model that can detect emotions from images in real-time.

> **Instructions:** The entire full notebook should run less than 35 minutes to run on *T4 GPU*. The solutions for this notebook are self-contained. This notebook was intended to be executed and tested on *Google Colab*. Using the commands: `runtime` → `run all`.

> **Rationale:** There are some general understanding questions and interpretations of the model placed in markdown cells with this emoji (❓) and answers placed in cells with this emoji (✅). This will provide some context on the application and an explanation of some of the design decisions made.

> **Dataset:** Facial Expression Recognition 2013 Dataset. The required dataset is located within the `FER-2013.rar` file. Download it and store it in `Google Drive`. It should be under `My Drive`. Note: After uploading it, check the location by right-clicking on the file `File Information` → `Details` → `Location`.
